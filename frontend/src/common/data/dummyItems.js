    description: `The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. Located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., it has served as the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 when the national capital was moved from Philadelphia.[2] The White House is also a metonym for the Executive Office of the President.[3] The residence was designed by the Irish-born architect James Hoban in the Neoclassical style.[4] Hoban modeled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Constructed between 1792 and 1800, its exterior walls are Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he and his architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe added low colonnades on each wing to conceal what then were stables and storage.[5] In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by British forces in the burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semicircular South Portico in 1824 and the North Portico in 1829.
                  Because of crowding within the executive mansion, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved and expanded. In the Executive Residence, the third floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. The East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing walls and wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was constructed inside the walls. On the exterior, the Truman Balcony was added. Once the structural work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.
                  The present-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence (with six stories: the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, and a two-story basement), the West Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which previously served the State Department and other departments (it now houses additional offices for the president's staff and the vice president), and Blair House, a guest residence. In 2025, the Trump administration demolished the East Wing to make room for a planned new East Wing including the ballroom, which would be funded through private donations.[6] The property is maintained by the National Park Service as part of the White House and President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture.[7]`

    description: `The Cabin in the Woods is a 2011 science fiction[4] comedy horror film directed by Drew Goddard in his directorial 
                      debut, produced by Joss Whedon, and written by Whedon and Goddard.[5] It stars Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, 
                      Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, and Bradley Whitford. 
                      The plot follows a group of college students who retreat to a remote cabin in the woods where they fall victim to a variety of monsters while technicians manipulate events from an underground facility for a global purpose. 
                      Goddard and Whedon, who previously worked together on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, wrote the screenplay in three days,
                      [6]: 13  describing it as an attempt to "revitalize" the slasher film genre and as a critical satire on torture porn. 
                      The special effects, monster costumes, special makeup, and prosthetic makeup for the film were done by AFX Studio.
                      [7] Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May 2009 on an estimated budget of $30 million.
                      The film was originally slated for release on October 23, 2009, which was later delayed to February 5, 
                      2010,[8] by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and United Artists (UA), but was indefinitely shelved due to financial difficulties.
                       In 2011, Lionsgate Films picked up the distribution rights. The film premiered in December 2011 at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in Austin, 
                       Texas and was released in the United States on April 13, 2012, to critical and commercial success. It grossed $66.5 million worldwide,
                       and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay, tone, and performances.`
